## 📚 FeedStack-lite – Institution Feedback Management System
FeedStack-Lite is a lighter version of FeedStack (which used Firebase as backend).
This version uses Google Sheets for storing data.

FeedStack-Lite is a simple web-based feedback form designed for educational institutions to collect structured student feedback for subjects, teachers, and classroom environment.

This project was built to strengthen my frontend fundamentals and understand how form data can be connected to external services like Google Sheets without using a traditional backend.
